# taproom

`taproom` is a cozy terminal user interface (TUI) for Homebrew. It provides a fast and fluid way to explore formulae and casks directly in your terminal.

![](https://raw.github.com/hzqtc/taproom/master/screenshot.png)

`taproom` is inspired by [`boldbrew`](https://github.com/Valkyrie00/bold-brew) but it's not a clone.

- `taproom` has a different UI style
- `taproom` supports casks
- `taproom` supports sorting by different columns
- `taproom` shows missing dependencies recursively (i.e. dependencies of dependencies)
- `taproom` shows reverse dependencies (i.e. used by) that replaces an very slow `brew uses <formula> --eval-all` command
- `taproom` shows the size of installed packages

## ‚ú® Features

- **Table View:** Overview of all avaiable formulae and casks in Homebrew.
- **Detailed View:** Get more info on any package, including its description, version, homepage, license, dependencies, and 90-day install count.
  - Also shows dependencies recursively (only when the dependencies is not installed)
  - Also shows dependents (which other packages depends on this one)
- **Search:** Quickly find packages by name or description.
- **Filtering:** View all packages, or filter by:
  - Formulae only
  - Casks only
  - Installed packages
  - Outdated packages
  - Packages you installed explicitly (not as dependencies)
- **Flexible Sorting:** Sort packages alphabetically by name or by 90-day popularity.
- **Status Indicators:** See at a glance which packages are installed, outdated, or pinned.
- **Execute brew commands:** upgrade, install, uninstall, pin or unpin packages directly in the TUI.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- du (MacOS builtin command)
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- A terminal emulator with a [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)

### Install from pre-built binary

`gromgit` maintains a [formula](https://github.com/gromgit/homebrew-brewtils/blob/main/Formula/taproom.rb):

```
brew install gromgit/brewtils/taproom
```

Or use [`eget`](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget):

```
eget hzqtc/taproom
```

### Build from source

To build from source, follow these simple steps:

#### Build dependencies

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)

#### Build

1.  Navigate to the project directory.
2.  Build the binary:
    ```sh
    make
    ```
3.  Run the application:
    ```sh
    ./taproom
    ```

## ü™Ñ Customization

The app's behavior can be further customized with command line flags:

- `--invalidate-cahce` or `-i` in short: immediately invalidate cache and re-download data from brew.sh
- `--hide-columns`: hide and skip loading data for specified columns
  - This can be helpful to further simplify the UI
  - While all data loading is done in parallel, some may be slower than others. This flag can be used to skip loading certain data to speed up app load
- `--load-timer` or `-t` in short: show a timer in the loading screen

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
