# taproom

`taproom` is a cozy terminal user interface (TUI) for Homebrew. It provides a fast and fluid way to explore formulae and casks directly in your
terminal. `taproom` is inspired by [`boldbrew`](https://github.com/Valkyrie00/bold-brew).

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Table View:** All or selected formula or cask.
*   **Search:** Quickly find packages by name or description.
*   **Detailed View:** Get more info on any package, including its description, version, homepage, license, dependencies, and 90-day install count.
*   **Smart Filtering:** View all packages, or filter by:
    *   Formulae only
    *   Casks only
    *   Installed packages
    *   Outdated packages
    *   Packages you installed explicitly (not as dependencies)
*   **Flexible Sorting:** Sort packages alphabetically by name or by 90-day popularity.
*   **Status Indicators:** See at a glance which packages are installed, outdated, or pinned.
*   **Responsive Layout:** The UI adapts to your terminal window size.
